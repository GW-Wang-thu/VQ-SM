# VQ-SM: Surrogate model based on VQ-VAE for damage forecast of CFRP subjected to LVI
- A framework of using advanced representation learning technique VQ-VAE to enhance the performance of the surrogate model. 
- The forecast of full-field delamination and the matrix damages of CFRP are investigated subjected to LVIs of different impactor radius $R$, impact energy $E$ and the impact angle $\theta $.


## Environment
- python39
- pytorch (torch 1.12.1+cu116 used)

## Dataset

## The pre-trained models

## Evaluation using VQ-SM for damages

## Training a VQ-SM
